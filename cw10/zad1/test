Two ways to view the world
So similar at times
Two ways to rule the world
To justify their crimes
By kings and queens
Young men are sent
To die in war
Their propaganda speaks
Those words been heard before

Two ways to view the world
Brought Europe down In Flames

Two ways to rule...

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed
Cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

From dawn to dawn
They're fighting
Die where they stand
The fog of war lies thick
When armies scorch the land
When all of Europe is burning,
What can be done
They've been to war a decade,
Two more to come

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed
Cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

When they face death
They're all alike
No right or wrong
Rich or poor
No matter
Who they served before
Good or bad
They're all the same
Rest side by side now

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed
Cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed
Cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war
